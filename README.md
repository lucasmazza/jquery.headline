# jquery.headline

Text animation plugin extracted from the [9elements website](http://9elements.com) (original work by [@sebastiandeutsch](https://github.com/sebastiandeutsch)).

## Usage

First, include the `jquery.headline.js` script inside your page, then:

    $('#container').headline(['First line', 'Second', 'Third'])

Also, inside your CSS:

    .headline-off { visibility: hidden; }

And it works!

## Examples

There's a simple example page inside the `examples` directory and more demos at the [GitHub project page](http://lucasmazza.github.com/jquery.headline).

## Grab the code

* Minified version at `dist/`.

Have fun!
